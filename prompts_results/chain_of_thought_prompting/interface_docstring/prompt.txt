You are a software testing assistant. Your task is to generate a set of unit tests for a Python class provided below.

The tests should:
- use the `unittest` framework,
- cover all public methods,
- test typical usage as well as edge cases, invalid inputs, and exceptions,
- be clear, atomic, and minimal.

You will now analyze the class to prepare relevant test cases.
Do not write test code yet.

Below is the interface+docstrings of the class:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List


class Item(TypedDict):
    """
    Represents a single product entry in the order.

    :key name: The name of the product.
    :key price: The price per unit of the product.
    :key quantity: The number of units of the product.
    """

class OrderCalculator:
    def __init__(self, tax_rate=0.23, free_shipping_threshold=100.0, shipping_cost=10.0):
        """
        Initializes a new OrderCalculator instance.
        Initializes an empty list of items (each represented as a TypedDict 'Item')
        and stores the configured tax and shipping parameters.

        :param tax_rate: The percentage of tax applied to the final amount, expressed as a float between 0.0 and 1.0 (default is 0.23 for 23%).
        :param free_shipping_threshold: The minimum order value (after discount) that qualifies for free shipping (default is 100.0).
        :param shipping_cost: The cost of shipping applied if the order does not meet the free shipping threshold (default is 10.0).

        :raises ValueError:
            - If tax_rate is not in the range [0.0, 1.0].

```


2)
Based on the class above, list all relevant unit test scenarios you would create.
Each scenario should describe:
- the method being tested,
- the type of case (e.g. normal use, invalid input, exception),
- a short explanation of the intent.
List as many scenarios as you can think of, covering all aspects of the class.
Do not write test code yet.



3)
Now, based on the test scenarios you just listed, generate the complete Python unit test suite using the `unittest` framework.

Follow these rules:
- Include one test method per scenario.
- Use meaningful test method names.
- Do not include comments or explanations.
- Output a valid `.py` file containing only the test class.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT copy or redefine the OrderCalculator class in your test file. The class already exists in a separate module. Simply import it using: `from order_calculator import OrderCalculator`

The output must contain only Python code.
