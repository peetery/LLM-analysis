1)
You are a software testing assistant. Your task is to generate a set of unit tests for a Python class provided below.

The tests should:
- use the `unittest` framework,
- cover all public methods,
- test typical usage as well as edge cases, invalid inputs, and exceptions,
- be clear, atomic, and minimal.

You will now analyze the class to prepare relevant test cases.
Do not write test code yet. Do not write test scenarios yet. Just analyze the class and prepare for the next step.

Below is the class interface (without implementation):

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List


class Item(TypedDict)

class OrderCalculator:
    def __init__(self, tax_rate=0.23, free_shipping_threshold=100.0, shipping_cost=10.0):

    def add_item(self, name: str, price: float, quantity: int = 1):

    def remove_item(self, name: str):

    def get_subtotal(self) -> float:

    def apply_discount(self, subtotal: float, discount: float) -> float:

    def calculate_shipping(self, discounted_subtotal: float) -> float:

    def calculate_tax(self, amount: float) -> float:

    def calculate_total(self, discount: float = 0.0) -> float:

    def total_items(self) -> int:

    def clear_order(self):

    def list_items(self) -> List[str]:

	def is_empty(self) -> bool:

```



2)
Based on the class above, list all relevant unit test scenarios you would create.
Each scenario should describe:
- the method being tested,
- the type of case (e.g. normal use, invalid input, exception),
- a short explanation of the intent.
List as many scenarios as you can think of, covering all aspects of the class.
Do not write test code yet.



3)
Now, based on the test scenarios you just listed, generate the complete Python unit test suite using the `unittest` framework.

Follow these rules:
- Include one test method per scenario.
- Use meaningful test method names.
- Do not include comments or explanations.
- Output a valid `.py` file containing only the test class.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT copy or redefine the OrderCalculator class in your test file. The class already exists in a separate module. Simply import it using: `from order_calculator import OrderCalculator`

The output must contain only Python code.
